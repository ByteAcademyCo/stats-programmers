## 1.0 Background

The purpose of this tutorial is using your ability to code to help you understand probability and statistics.


### 1.1 Probability

Probability is the study of random events.

### 1.2 Statistics

Statistics is the discipline of using data samples to support claims about populations. Most statistical analysis is based on probability, which is why these pieces are usually presented together.

#### 1.2.1 Data collection 


#### 1.2.2 Descriptive statistics 

Descriptive statistics refers to the generation of statistics that summarize your data concisely and evaluate different ways to visualize data.

#### 1.2.3 Exploratory data analysis

During the process of exploratory data analysis, we look for patterns, differences, and other features that address the questions we are interested in.At the same time we will check for inconsistencies and identify limitations.

#### 1.2.4 Hypothesis testing 

Where we see apparent effects, like a difference between two groups, we will evaluate whether the effect is real, or whether it might have happened by chance.

#### 1.2.5 Estimation 

We will use data from a sample to estimate characteristics of the general population.

### 1.3 Computation

Computation is a tool that is well-suited to quantitative analysis, and computers are commonly used to process statistics. Also, computational experiments are useful for exploring concepts in probability and statistics.

###  Z-Values

Z-value is a measure of standard deviation, i.e. how many standard deviation away from mean is the observed value. For example, the value of z-value = +1.8 can be interpreted as the observed value is +1.8 standard deviations away from the mean. 


### P-Values

Meaningwhile, P values are probabilities. Both these statistics terms are associated with the standard normal distribution.
